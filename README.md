Robot Landmine Sweeper

This Arduino Uno project detects mines moving within a grid. The use of mines nowadays are viewd as inhumane by most NATO countries which have condemned their use and production. The project aimed to develop a robot vehicle for the detection of landmines for safe deactivation of mines that could lay dormant underground.
